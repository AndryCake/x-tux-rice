# x-tux-rice

# xTuxRice is our attempt at the best rice (which is suited for a tiling WM, however it might work on floating WMs as well, but those are unnoficial). Anyone can contribute!

### Note: Currently, xTuxRice does not provide configs for WMs, but the _shell apps_, as we call them, make most of the experience. We'll later add configs for different WMs in different branches.
